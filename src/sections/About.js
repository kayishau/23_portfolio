          Though my B.S. is in Interior Design, I've always had an affinity for Tech, dating back to when I first joined my highschool robotics team and competed on a national stage. Later in life, after a joining a <span><a href="https://twitter.com/litter_token?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target={"_blank"} className="underline">Web3 project based off of my love for the enviroment</a>, I was introduced to the world of blockchain, ReFi, tokenomics, crypto, smart contracts, ZK etc. which reignited my desire to become an engineer.</span> After completing an Immersive bootcamp and learning the basics, I took it upon myself to keep building and I'm excited to keep growing and see where this journey leads me.

            When I'm not hacking away, you'll usually find me hiking, reading, playing sports (volleyball or football are my go-tos), playing my sax, attemptinig to learn a new language, hitting up bachata or salsa classes or curating the freshest of playlist. My go to song for an energy boost is 'La Santa' by Bad Bunny and my tops genres are Afrobeats, Reggaeton and RnB. In a crowded room, I am defineltey the one who iniaties the dancing.
